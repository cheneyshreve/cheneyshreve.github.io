## Explanation
Bloc Chat is a chatroom app that I built with Create React App. While I'm currently engaged in backend development using ruby on rails, I completed several frontend projects utilizing libraries such as jQuery and React during earlier coursework at Bloc. This app utilizes Firebase as a Backend as a Service (BaaS) to support user data needs.

## Problem
Users want to be able to quickly and effortlessly create and edit chatrooms, as well as send, receive and edit messages across user sessions.

## Solution
Firebase offers a great solution for storing user data and allowing real time interaction with the database, which gives users the interactivity and responsiveness they desire. To facilitate styling the app, I used CSS Grid.

## Results & Conclusions
Coupling React with firebase is an ideal solution for an independent developer who may not have the time to build or manage their own database, or for other simple applications.
