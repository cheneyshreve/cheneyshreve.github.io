## Blocmetrics is an analytics service to track events on websites that I recently completed as a part of the backend foundations training at Bloc. Check out the live version of the app on [Heroku](https://stark-forest-69447.herokuapp.com/) here.

### Key features of Blocmetrics include:
- A server-side API that captures and saves events to a database built with Rails 5.1.5
- A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows users to track events on their website
- A web accessible rails application that displays the captured event data for a user
- Graphs of event data displayed using Chartkick and Groupdate download option

### Key challenges and learinng outcomes
I'm familiar with using the devise gem to manage user authentication and authorization from earlier projects, however, one of the things that the Bloc curriculum does not cover is deploying to Heroku, or debugging production related errors.
