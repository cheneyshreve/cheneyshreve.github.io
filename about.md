Hi there, I'm Cheney. I'm a scientist and software engineer in training. I'm currently a student at Bloc in their software engineering track. Here's a brief overview of the programming languages and technologies I'm experienced with:

Programming languages
- proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby
- prior experience with: IDL, Matlab, R

Image processing software
- ArcGIS, ENVI/IDL, ERDAS, Google Earth Engine

Libraries and frameworks
- jQuery, React, ruby-on-rails

Other technologies
- Firebase
- AWS
- Heroku

My educational background is in environmental sciences and disaster risk reduction. My first exposure to computer programming was during my doctorate, where I had to teach myself how program in a language called IDL in order to complete my research. My research involved processing thousands of optical satellite images acquired over the Tibetan Plateau to map land cover change and better understand how this relates to change in climate variables. I also utilized Matlab, and later R, for other statistical and data visualization applications during Postdoctoral work.

Following that, I worked more on the social aspect of environmental challenges, such as disaster preparedness and disaster risk reduction (DRR). I spent time as an independent consultant working for organizations such as UNEP, Climate Services Center, and Save the Children on climate change and DRR topics. For a two-year Postdoctoral position in England, I worked on a multi-country project on disaster preparedness called [TACTIC](https://www.tacticproject.eu/). A centerpiece of this project was an emergency preparedness app. While I wasn't involved in the technical development of this app, as my primary role was in developing the context and content of the app, it was a turning point! I realized just how critical software is in today's society, and how important it is for keeping people informed, happy, and safe!

My other hat is (eco)feminism. If you're scratching your head wondering what the heck ecofeminism is, well, I was too a few years back. It really boils down to a recognition that resources here on this lovely planet are not infinite, and better management is vital as we continue to grow and change. Turns out recognizing the needs of women and non-binary individuals will make everyone healthier, happy, and yes, even more profitable.
